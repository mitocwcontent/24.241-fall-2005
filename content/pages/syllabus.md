Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course provides an introduction to the aims and techniques of formal logic. Logic is the science of correct argument, and our study of logic will aim to understand what makes a correct argument good, that is, what is it about the structure of a correct argument that guarantees that, if the premises are all true, the conclusion will be true as well? Our subject (though, to be sure, we can only scratch the surface) will be truth and proof, and the connection between them.

Course Requirements
-------------------

There will be a homework assignment every week or every other week, and a mandatory 3-hour, open-book final exam. The final will carry the same weight as three homework assignments.

Collaboration Policy
--------------------

I encourage you to work together on the problems, but when you sit down to write up your final answers, do it by yourself, without looking at anyone else's work.

Course Calendar
---------------

The calendar below provides information on the course topics, which are taken from chapters in the course manuscript. The manuscript entitled _Logic: The Art of Persuasion and the Science of Truth_ was written by the faculty member and is available in the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) section.
